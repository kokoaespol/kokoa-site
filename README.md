## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Setup

It is recommended to use VSCode with the Eslint, Prettier, Svelte, and TailwindCSS Extensions.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.
